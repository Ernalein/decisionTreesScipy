Notes

6 files (wtf)
3 classes to build the tree:
    1) prepare_data.py -> prepares/changes the data before testing and training
    2) split_data.py -> calulates the splitting step of ID3
    3) main.py -> comparing and visualisation

QUESTIONS
***

what is a decision tree:
    - binary tree -> recursively splits the data
    
do we need a file for data

what data do we use

ID3:
    recursive function
    base cases:
        1) all instances have same target value -> leaf node with target value
        2) out of discriptive features -> leaf node with majority of target values
        return
        3) no instances left in dataset -> take majority of parent node
        return
    
    recursive call:
        1) choose feature with most expainatory power -> when data parted according to this feature -> highes information gain
        2) partition data on feature values
        3) remove feature from feature list
        4) recursive call on all partitions

    - need to calculate entropie somehow
    - target and discriptive features
    - 

how to do a tree in python:
    - just with class node
    - data is pandas dataframe that is devided
